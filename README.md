### Mahjong-Bingo: A Bingo game of Mahjong Tiles in Taiwan Night Market

This project is co-developed by Ken, Kevin and Martin. To start the game, you can simply open the Mahjong-Bingo.jar.

### Motivation: Why Mahjong-Bingo

We were exchanging students visiting National Cheng Kung University (or simply NCKU) during Summer Semister in 2018. Our team was attending a JAVA programming course and was required to complete a project using JAVA programming. 

In a visiting to Tainan night market, we observed citizens playing this gmae. We had a deep impression towards this interesting game since we saw no one won any prizes and thus aroused our interest to study this game.

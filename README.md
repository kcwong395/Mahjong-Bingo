## Motivation

We were exchanging students visiting National Cheng Kung University (or simply NCKU) during Summer Semester in 2018. Our team was attending a JAVA programming course and was required to complete a project using JAVA programming.

In a visit to Tainan night market, we observed citizens playing this game. We had a deep impression towards this interesting game since we saw no one won any prizes and thus aroused our interest to study this game.

## Install

Git Clone this project, you should be able to find a jar file named Mahjong-Bingo.jar.
To start the game, you can simply open the Mahjong-Bingo.jar.
Then, you should be able to see the following page:

## Usage

This is the game flow:
1. Draw 15 face-down Mahjong tiles
2. Click to reveal the tiles
3. Drag the tiles to the correspondent place which shares the same picture
4. If any six of the tiles complete a line (no matter it is **horizontal, vertical and diagonal**), you win
5. If there are five tiles connected while no line is completed, get extra 3 tiles and continue the game
6. You lose when you have no tiles and no line is completed

Winning Conditions:

<img src="img_for_readme/verti.PNG" alt="verti con" />
<img src="img_for_readme/dia.PNG" alt="dia con" />

## Future Plan

1. We are looking for some no copyright music and sound effect which fit the style of the game
2. ~We keen to find some picture of hot ladies to replace the two stitches~
